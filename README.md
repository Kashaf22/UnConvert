### Notes

Did you face any challenges while making this application ? 

I faced a bug while making this app. I defined a textView to display the pounds value on the screen. When I ran the app, this textView would not show up on the screen. I debugged my activity_main.xml and 
I realized my textView's vertcial bias was set to a high value thats why this field was sliding up vertically on the screen to a level where it was not displayable. Once, I changed this value
my application ran fine.
